This is the React comment box example from [the React tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) ported to [react-dart](https://github.com/cleandart/react-dart).

## Instructions

Currently the code should be the same as in tutorial20.js on [the React tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html). 

The servers are not included in this repo, you could get them from [the React tutorial repo](https://github.com/reactjs/react-tutorial).
