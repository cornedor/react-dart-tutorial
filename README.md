# React Dart Tutorial

This is the React comment box example from [the React tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) ported to [react-dart](https://github.com/cleandart/react-dart).

## This is a WIP

Currently the code should be the same as in tutorial13.js on [the React tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html).

Warning: This code makes use of [a small patch](https://github.com/cornedor/react-dart/commit/b19802af0ee72c1b8a28e8a06d9b1e6d84231b74) in react-dart.
